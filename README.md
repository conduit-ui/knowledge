# Knowledge

AI-powered knowledge base with semantic search and ChromaDB integration.

## Vision

- **Test-Driven**: 100% coverage enforced via Synapse Sentinel
- **Quality-First**: Maximum static analysis (PHPStan level 8)

```

## Quality Standards

- **Test Coverage**: 100% (enforced by Synapse Sentinel)
